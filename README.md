# Description:

  Micro-positioning stage. 
 
  Author: radiogeek381@gmail.com

  A simple sliding table that can be positioned via a 4-40 or M3 screw. 
  
  It requires a 3D printer and a Flavia stick.  The stick is used for
  the linear bearing.  Other things might suffice, but I had some of
  these around.
